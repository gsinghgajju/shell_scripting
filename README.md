# shell_scripting

this is the repo where we are writing automation scripts for the servers we are going to use and the required software will be sitting here so that instead of installing them one by one we simply run bash script and all installation related to server happen in one click.

and we have 6 servers and going to install software in them but we are pushing them to repo and then install direct using bash script to the respective server.
